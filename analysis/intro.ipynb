      "Description: The CatWISE2020 Catalogue consists of 1,890,715,640 sources over the entire sky selected from Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and NEOWISE survey data at 3.4 and 4.6 micrometer (W1 and W2) collected from 7 January 2010 to 13 December 2018. This data set adds two years to that used for the CatWISE Preliminary Catalogue (Eisenhardt+, 2020ApJS..247...69E, 2020ApJS..247...69E), bringing the total to six times as many exposures spanning over sixteen times as large a time baseline as the AllWISE catalogue. The other major change from the CatWISE Preliminary Catalogue is that the detection list for the CatWISE2020 Catalogue was generated using \"crowdsource\" software (Schlafly+, 2019ApJS..240...30S, 2019ApJS..240...30S), while the CatWISE Preliminary Catalogue used the detection software used for AllWISE. These two factors result in roughly twice as many sources in the CatWISE2020 Catalogue. The 90% completeness depth for the CatWISE2020 Catalogue is at W1 = 17.7 mag and W2 = 17.5 mag, 1.7 mag deeper than in the CatWISE Preliminary Catalogue. This table has been created in May 2023 based on the VizieR version of the CatWISE2020 Catalogue (see <a href=\"https://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=II/365\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"Follow link\">https://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=II/365</a>).

      "Original table description: Stellar physical and dynamical properties are essential knowledge to understanding the structure, formation, and evolution of our Galaxy. We produced an all-sky uniformly derived catalog of stellar astrophysical parameters (APs; age, mass, temperature, bolometric luminosity, distance, dust extinction) to give insight into the physical properties of Milky-Way stars. Exploiting the power of multi-wavelength and multi-survey observations from Gaia DR2 parallaxes and integrated photometry along with 2MASS and AllWISE photometry, we introduce an all-sky uniformly derived catalog of stellar astrophysical parameters, including dust extinction (A0) and average grain size (R0) along the line of sight, for 123,076,271 stars. In contrast with previous works, we do not use a Galactic model as prior in our analysis. We validate our results against other literature (e.g., benchmark stars, interferometry, Bayestar, StarHorse). The limited optical information in the Gaia photometric bands or the lack of ultraviolet or spectroscopic information renders the chemistry inference prior dominated. We demonstrate that Gaia parallaxes bring sufficient leverage to explore the detailed structures of the interstellar medium in our Milky Way. In Gaia DR3, we will obtain the dispersed optical light information to break through some limitations of this analysis, allowing us to infer stellar chemistry in particular. Gaia promises us data to construct the most detailed view of the chemo-dynamics of field star populations in our Galaxy.\n",

The catalogue provides distances estimates (and uncertainties therein) for 1.33 billion stars over the whole sky brighter than about G=20.7. These have been estimated using the parallaxes (and their uncertainties) from Gaia data release 2. A Bayesian procedure was used involving a prior with a single parameter L(l,b), which varies smoothly with Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The posterior is summarized with a point estimate (usually the mode) and a confidence interval (usually the 68% highest density interval). The estimation procedure is described in detail in the accompanying paper, which also analyses the catalogue content. The catalogue comprises one table with 1.33 billion rows and seven columns. The accompanying paper explains under what circumstances the different estimates/modality occur. These should not be mixed in any statistical analyses. Around 99.9% of all sources have result_flag=1 and modality_flag=1.\n",

      "The Gaia mission is delivering exquisite astrometric data for 1.47 billion sources, which are revolutionizing many fields in astronomy. For a small fraction of these sources the astrometric solutions are poor, and the reported values and uncertainties may not apply. Before any analysis, it is important to recognize and excise these spurious results, commonly done by means of quality flags in the Gaia catalog. Here we devise and apply a path to separating “good” from “bad” astrometric solutions that is an order-of-magnitude cleaner than any single flag: 99.3% pure and 97.3% complete, as validated on our test data. We devise an extensive sample of manifestly bad astrometric solutions: sources whose inferred parallax is negative at ≥ 4.5 sigma; and a corresponding sample of presumably good solutions falling into a number of categories, including sources in HEALPix pixels on the sky that do not contain extremely negative parallaxes, and sources that fall on the main sequence in a color–absolute magnitude diagram. We then train a neural network that uses 17 pertinent Gaia catalog entries and information about nearby sources to discriminate these two samples, captured in a single “astrometric fidelity” parameter. An extensive and diverse set of verification tests shows that our approach to assessing astrometric fidelity works very cleanly, including in the regime where no negative parallaxes are involved. The main limitations of our approach are in the very low-SNR, crowded regime. Our astrometric fidelities for all of eDR3 can be queried via the Virtual Observatory. In the spirit of open science, we make our code and training/validation data public, so that our results can be easily reproduced.\n",

      "Abstract: The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) imaged the sky in two ultraviolet (UV) bands, far-UV (FUV, lambda_eff∼1528A), and near-UV (NUV, lambda_eff∼2310A), delivering the first comprehensive sky surveys at these wavelengths. The GALEX database contains FUV and NUV images, ∼500 million source measurements and over 100000 low-resolution UV spectra. The UV surveys are a unique resource for statistical studies of hot stellar objects, z≲2 QSOs, star-forming galaxies, nebulae and the interstellar medium, and provide a roadmap for planning future UV instrumentation and follow-up observing programs. We present science-enhanced, \"clean\" catalogs of GALEX UV sources, with useful tags to facilitate scientific investigations. The catalogs are an improved and expanded version of our previous catalogs of UV sources (BCScat; Bianchi+, 2011, J/MNRAS/411/2770 ; II/312 and 2014AdSpR..53..900B 2014AdSpR..53..900B). With respect to BCScat, we have patched 640 fields for which the pipeline had improperly coadded non-overlapping observations, and we provide a version with a larger sky coverage (about 10%) by relaxing the restriction to the central area of the GALEX field to 1.1 deg diameter (GUVcatAISfov055: GUVcat_AIS FOV_radius <0.55 deg), as well as the cleaner, more restrictive version using only the 1 deg central portion of each field as in BCScat (GUVcatAISfov050: GUVcat_AIS FOV_radius <0.50 deg). We added new tags to facilitate selection and cleaning of statistical samples for science applications: we flag sources within the footprint of extended objects (nearby galaxies, stellar clusters) so that these regions can be excluded for estimating source density. As in our previous catalogs, in GUVcat duplicate measurements of the same source are removed, so that each astrophysical object has only one entry. Such a unique-source catalog is needed to study the density and distributions of sources, and to match UV sources with catalogs at other wavelengths. The catalog includes all observations from the All-Sky Imaging Survey (AIS), the survey with the largest area coverage, with both FUV and NUV detectors exposed: over 28700 fields, made up of a total of 57000 observations (\"visits\"). The total area covered, when overlaps are removed and gaps are accounted for, is 24790 square degrees for GUVcatAISfov055 (GUVcatAISfov055) and 22125 square degrees for (GUVcatAISfov050). The total numbers of \"unique\" AIS sources (eliminating duplicate measurements) are 82,992,086 (GUVcatAISfov055) and 69,772,677 (GUVcatAISfov050). The typical depth of the GUVcat_AIS catalog is FUV=19.9, NUV=20.8 AB mag.\n",

Unknown: Primary objects which are none of the above. Each physical object on the sky has only one primary object associated with it. Upon subsequent observations secondary objects are generated. Since the survey stripes overlap, there will be secondary objects for over 10% of all primary objects, and in the southern stripes there will be a multitude of secondary objects for each primary (i.e. reobservations).\n",
