Project Description
-------------------
The primary objective of this project is to ensure the reproducibility of results presented in the paper: `Milky Way’s Eccentric Constituents with Gaia, APOGEE, and GALAH <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8d68>`_. In addition to replicating the original analysis, this work explores the use of dimensionality reduction techniques to:

1. Better understand the coherence of stellar populations identified through high dimensional clustering.
2. Compare the success of the APOGEE and GALAH surveys in recovering the Milky Way’s assembly history through chemo-dynamical analysis
3. Prepose suggestions to future approaches of clustering algorthims to improve convergence, scalability and stability for greater applicability to the larger scale datasets from upcoming spectroscopic surveys such as WEAVE and 4MOST.
